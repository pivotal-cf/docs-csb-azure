<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This documentation tells you about <%= vars.product_full %>.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The <%= vars.product_full %> enables platform operators to easily expose services
to their developers from Azure with an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach.
<%= vars.product_short %> is thoroughly extensible, and can expose new services or public clouds
through the use of custom brokerpaks that rely on OpenTofu providers.

## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

<%= vars.product_short %> includes the following key features:

- **Easily extensible and maintainable:** <%= vars.product_short %> uses brokerpaks to expose
services. If your target public cloud has a OpenTofu provider, you can provision services
through a common interface using standard Cloud Foundry CLI (cf CLI) commands.
For more information about brokerpaks, see
[Brokerpak Introduction](https://github.com/pivotal/cloud-service-broker/blob/master/docs/brokerpak-intro.md)
in GitHub.
- **One common broker for all brokered services:** <%= vars.product_short %> decouples the service
broker functionality from the catalog of services that it exposes.
- **CredHub integration out-of-the-box:** CredHub encrypts and manages all the secrets associated
with your usage of cloud services.
- **Community:** When you expose a service through a brokerpak, you can make it available to
everyone who uses <%= vars.product_short %> and vice versa. For more information, see the
[Brokerpak Introduction](https://github.com/pivotal/cloud-service-broker/blob/master/docs/brokerpak-intro.md)
in GitHub.
