<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %> v1.1.8 and earlier to v1.1.9.

Follow the procedure in this topic if you use:

+ <%= vars.product_short %> v1.1.8 or earlier
+ The `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small` plan or `csb-azure-mssql/small` plan

<p class="note">
   <strong>Note:</strong> Skip this topic if you do not use the exact components and versions listed above.
</p>

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

In <%= vars.product_short %> v1.1.8 and earlier, the `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small` plan
and the `csb-azure-mssql/small` plan have the same internal identifier.
These identifiers should be unique.

<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 checks for duplicate plan identifiers, resulting in
<%= vars.product_short %> v1.1.8 and earlier failing to install on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11.
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.10 and earlier did not check for duplicate plan identifiers.

In <%= vars.product_short %> v1.1.9:

* The `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small-v2` plan replaces the `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small` plan
* The `csb-azure-mssql/small-v2` plan replaces the `csb-azure-mssql/small` plan.

The new v2 plans have different internal identifiers, but are otherwise identical to the old small plans.

## <a id="upgrade"></a> Process for Upgrading to <%= vars.product_short %> v1.1.9

If you use the `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small` plan or the `csb-azure-mssql/small` plan,
the process for upgrading to v1.1.9 or later is:

1. Upgrade the tile to v1.1.9 or later as you normally upgrade a tile.

2. Identify the GUIDs for the service instances using the small plans of the `csb-azure-mssql`
   and `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small` services.

3. Update the service instances to use the new small-v2 plans for the two services.

4. Remove the small plans from the Marketplace.

For detailed procedures for steps 2â€“4 see [Update csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small Service Instances](#update-failover)
and [Update csb-azure-mssql/small Service Instances](#update-mssql) below.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisite

To follow the procedures in this topic, you need the jq tool installed.
See [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).


## <a id="update-failover"></a> Update csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small Service Instances

If your foundation uses the `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small` plan,
follow the procedures below:

+ [Identify the GUIDs for the Service Instances Using the Small Plans](#id-failover)
+ [Update Service Instances to Use small-v2 Plan](#update-si-failover)
+ [Remove the Small Plan from the Marketplace](#remove-failover)

You do not need to follow these steps immediately after upgrading to v1.1.9.
You can perform them at any time, and, if necessary, you can update the service instances independently.

###<a id="id-failover"></a> Identify the GUIDs for the Service Instances Using the Small Plans

The steps below describe how to get a list of service instance names that use the small plan.
If you already have such a list, then skip to [Update Service Instances to Use small-v2 Plan](#update-si-failover) below.

To output a list of instances and GUIDs of the `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group` service that use the `small` plan:

1. Set a shell variable named `SERVICE_GUID` to the GUID of the `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group`
    service by running:

    ```
    SERVICE_GUID="$(cf curl /v2/services?q=label:csb-azure-mssql-failover-group | jq -r .resources[0].metadata.guid)"
    ```

1. Set a shell variable named `PLAN_GUID` to the GUID of the small service plan
    by running:

    ```
    PLAN_GUID="$(cf curl "/v2/service_plans?q=service_guid:$SERVICE_GUID&q=unique_id:a556d1b4-5825-11ea-adb8-00155d4dfe6c" | jq -r .resources[0].metadata.guid)"
     ```
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> <code>a556d1b4-5825-11ea-adb8-00155d4dfe6c</code> is always the internal
      identifier for the <code>small</code> plan.
    </p>

1. Discover the GUIDs of the service instances that you need to update by running:

    ```
    cf curl "/v2/service_instances?q=service_plan_guid:$PLAN_GUID" | jq -r .resources[].metadata.guid
    ```
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ cf curl "/v2/service_instances?q=service_plan_guid:$PLAN_GUID" \
    | jq -r .resources[].metadata.guid
    c08199a9-a41d-483d-8d07-58347467623e
    f28d32af-fbda-4057-9080-f655feda8c98
    </pre>

    If the result is empty, then there are no service instances that need to be updated
    and you can skip to [Remove the Small Plan from the Marketplace](#remove-failover).


1. For each service instance identified earlier, discover the service instance name,
    space name, and org name by running:

    ```
    cf curl "/v2/service_instances/GUID?inline-relations-depth=2&include-relations=space,organization" | jq -r \
    '{service: .entity.name, space: .entity.space.entity.name, organization: .entity.space.entity.organization.entity.name}'
    ```
    Where `GUID` is the GUID of a service instance, listed in the output earlier.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ cf curl "/v2/service_instances/c08199a9-a41d-483d-8d07-58347467623e?inline-relations-depth=2&include-relations=space,organization" | jq -r \
    '{service: .entity.name, space: .entity.space.entity.name, organization: .entity.space.entity.organization.entity.name}'
    {
      "service": "my-database",
      "space": "services",
      "organization": "system"
    }
    </pre>

###<a id=update-si-failover></a> Update Service Instances to Use small-v2 Plan

Follow these steps for each service instance using the small plan.
That is for each service instance in the list output printed earlier.

To update a service instance to use the small-v2 plan instead of the small plan:

7. Target the org and space for the service instance by running:

    ```
    cf target -o ORG-NAME -s SPACE-NAME
    ```
    Where `ORG-NAME`and `SPACE-NAME` are the values obtained in the procedure above.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf target -o system -s services
    </pre>

8. Update the service instance to use the new small-v2 plan by running:

    ```
    cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME -p small-v2  -c '{"PARAMETER-1-NAME":"PARAMETER-1-VALUE","PARAMETER-2-NAME":"PARAMETER-2-VALUE"}'
    ```
    Where:
    * `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` is the name obtained in the procedure above.
    * `PARAMETER-n-NAME` and `PARAMETER-n-VALUE` are the names and values of any parameters
       that you set when you last updated the service instance.
       For a list of the parameters,
       see [Configuration Parameters](reference.html#azure-mssql-fog-parameters)
       in _Service Plan Reference_.<br>
       If you do not specify the parameters, the parameters default back to the values
       that they had when the service instance was created.
       For more information,
       see [Known Issues](https://docs.pivotal.io/csb-azure/1-1/release-notes.html#1-1-9)
       in the _Release Notes_.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf update-service my-database -p small-v2 -c '{"instance_name": "myinstance"}'
    </pre>


###<a id="remove-failover"></a> Remove the Small Plan from the Marketplace

The last task is to remove the small plan from the Marketplace
so that no one can choose it in the future.

1. Remove the original small plan by running:

    ```
    cf curl -X DELETE /v2/service_plans/$PLAN_GUID
    ```

    If you get an error with error code `CF-ServicePlanNotFound` then Cloud Foundry
    has already detected that the plan is no longer in use and has removed it.

1. Confirm that the original small plan has been removed by running:

    ```
    cf marketplace -s csb-azure-mssql-failover-group
    ```
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace -s csb-azure-mssql-failover-group
    Getting service plan information for service csb-azure-mssql-failover-group as admin...
    OK

    service plan   description                                                                                                                                                                      free or paid

    </pre>

## <a id="update-mssql"></a> Update csb-azure-mssql/small Service Instances

<%# After the above procedures are perfect-enough, then copy them below and replace the service name.
Although it seems repetitious, it will allow customers to copy/paste the commands

Also remember to change the x-ref for the config params to reference.html#azure-mssql-fog-parameters %>

To update the service instances for the csb-azure-mssql/small plan to the csb-azure-mssql/small-v2 plan,
follow the procedures in [Update csb-azure-mssql-failover-group/small Service
Instances](#update-failover) above with the following differences:

* Substitute `csb-azure-mssql` for `csb-azure-mssql-failover-group` throughout.
* For list of parameters for the `csb-azure-mssql` group,
  see [Configuration Parameters](reference.html#azure-mssql-parameters) in _Service Plan Reference_.
