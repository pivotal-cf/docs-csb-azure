Would you like to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %>? The following sections tell you about the
[upgrade procedure](#procedure), [upgrading service instances](#upgrade-instances), and specific
details about [upgrading to v1.6](#upgrading-specifics).

## Pre-upgrade procedure

<p class="note important">
<span class="note__title">Important</span>Before upgrading, it is crucial to perform the checks suggested in this section.</span>
  Failure to do so can cause the upgrade to fail and leave the broker unable to manage your instances.
</p>

* **Check if services are up-to-date**
   Execute the command:

   ```shell
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -check-up-to-date
   ```

   This command checks whether all services provided by the specified broker are up-to-date.
   An instance is considered not up-to-date if it is pending upgrade, or if it is an orphaned service instance.

* **Check for orphaned service instances**
   For greater granularity, you can specifically check only orphan service instances by running this command:

   ```shell
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -check-deactivated-plans
   ```

   This checks for any service instances still using plans that have been deactivated.
   For more information, see [Managing orphaned service instances documentation](./managing_orphaned_service_instances.html.md.erb).


## <a id="procedure"></a> Upgrade procedure

To upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Before you stage the new tile version, [ensure that all service instances are up to date](#upgrade-instances).
   Installation stops if there are any outdated instances, and you cannot use Tanzu Operations Manager
   to add or modify any plans. If your installation stops,
   [manually upgrade any outdated instances](#upgrading-cli-plugin) before trying to install the
   software again.

2. Download the new version of <%= vars.product_short %> from
   [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=Tanzu%20Cloud%20Service%20Broker%20for%20Azure).

3. Stage and configure the tile by following the instructions in
   [Installing with Azure](installing-with-azure.html.md.erb).

4. Make all the changes described in [Upgrading to v1.6](#upgrading-specifics).

5. Verify that your configuration complies with the
   [Important notes about upgrading service instances](#upgrade-notes) section later in this topic,
   especially regarding upgrading all instances, plans, and beta offerings.

6. Go to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

7. Click **Review Pending Changes** and then click **Apply Changes**.

8. Review the `deploy-all` errand logs for any errors that the upgrade instances task caused.

### <a id="upgrade-instances"></a> Verify that service instances are up to date before upgrading the tile

You might be unable to upgrade service instances that you did not upgrade with an earlier version of
the tile. A step in the installation phase stops the process if there are any outdated instances.

For these reasons, verify that there are no service instances pending upgrade before staging the new
version of the tile.

You can see whether there are instances with a pending upgrade by using the CLI plug-in.
For more information, see [ensuring all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in](#checking-cli-plugin).

If you find any instances that are pending upgrades, follow the upgrading instructions for your
current version.

### <a id="upgrade-notes"></a> Important notes about upgrading service instances

Before you start upgrading service instances, see the following notes:

- **Enabling the Upgrade all services check box:**

  If the **Upgrade all services** check box is not selected, service instances are not upgraded
  during installation. These instances become unmanageable by the broker.
  Any operations on that instance, such as update, bind, unbind, or delete, are blocked
  until you run the upgrade task.
  You can run the upgrade task at any time before upgrading the product to a later version.
  See [Upgrade All Service Instances configuration](installing-with-azure.html.md.erb#upgrade-all-config) for information
  about how to configure this task.
  Alternatively, you can run the upgrade at a later stage by using the [CLI plug-in](#upgrading-cli-plugin).

- **Enabling the Enable Beta offerings check box:**

  If the **Enable Beta offerings** check box is not selected when applying changes, instances from
  those service offerings are not upgraded. These instances become unmanageable by the broker.
  Verify that the **Enable Beta offerings** check box is selected if you have instances from those
  offerings that you intend to keep updated.

- **Deleting custom plans:**

  If you delete custom plans before upgrading all instances, instances from these plans are not
  upgraded. These instances become unmanageable by the broker. Delete plans after upgrading all
  instances, or see [Release Notes for Cloud Service Broker for Azure](release-notes.html.md.erb)
  and [Upgrading to v1.6](#upgrading-specifics) to prevent conflicting upgrades.

- **Only upgrade the tile after all service instances are up to date:**

  You can run the upgrade all instances task as many times as needed.
  If preferred, you can run the upgrade all instances task by using the cf CLI instead of,
  or in addition to, running it through the tile.
  Failure to upgrade one or more instances does not cause the tile installation to fail.
  Review the `deploy all` errand logs to verify that all instances have upgraded.

### <a id="checking-cli-plugin"></a> Verify that all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in

To verify that no instances are pending upgrade:

1. Install the [cf CLI UpgradeAllServices plug-in on Cloud Foundry](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#UpgradeAllServices).

2. Follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the `README` in the
   [upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin#usage)
   GitHub repository to perform a `check-up-to-date` command.

   `check-up-to-date` example:

   ```shell
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -check-up-to-date
   ```

   These command provide a list, from enabled plans, of instances that are pending upgrades, and a list of
   orphaned service instances that belong to deactivated plans.
   Manage all the instances listed before attempting a tile upgrade.

### <a id="upgrading-cli-plugin"></a> Upgrade instances through the CLI plug-in

To use the cf CLI plug-in to upgrade instances:

1. Install the [cf CLI UpgradeAllServices plug-in on Cloud Foundry](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#UpgradeAllServices).

2. To run the upgrade, follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the `README` in the
   [upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin#usage)
   GitHub repository.

   For example:

   ```shell
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME
   ```
