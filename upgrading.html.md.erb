This topic tells you how to upgrade <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id="procedure"></a> Upgrade procedure

<p class="note important">
   <strong>Important:</strong> When upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, service instances might need
   to be upgraded.
   Failure to upgrade one or more instance does not cause the tile installation to fail.<br><br>
   Review the <code>deploy-all</code> errand logs in the change log to verify that
   no errors occurred when upgrading instances. For more information about the service instance
   upgrade procedure, see <a href="#upgrade-instances">Upgrading service instances</a> later in this
   topic.
</p>

To upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Before you stage the new tile version,
   [ensure that all service instances are up to date](#upgrade-instances).

2. Download the new version of <%= vars.product_short %> from
   [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/cloud-service-broker-azure/).

3. Stage and configure the tile by following the instructions in
   [Installing with Azure](installing-with-azure.html.md.erb).

4. Make all the changes described in [Upgrading to v1.5](#upgrading-specifics).

5. Verify that the **Upgrade All Service Instances** task is configured as required.
   See [Upgrade All Service Instances configuration](installing-with-azure.html.md.erb#upgrade-all-config).

6. Verify that your configuration complies with the
   [Important notes about upgrading service instances](#upgrade-notes) section later in this topic, especially regarding plans
   and beta offerings.

7. Go to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

8. Click **Review Pending Changes** and then click **Apply Changes**.

9. Review the `deploy-all` errand logs for any errors created because of the upgrade instances task.

### <a id="upgrade-instances"></a> Ensure that service instances are up to date before upgrading the tile

Service instance upgrades must be performed alongside the corresponding tile upgrade.
Service instances that haven't been upgraded with one version might not be upgradable with
upcoming versions.
For this reason, verify that there are no instances pending upgrade before upgrading the tile to a
later version.

You can see whether there are instances with a pending upgrade by reviewing the last `deploy-all` errand
log for <%= vars.product_short %>. Alternatively, you can
[ensure all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in](#checking-cli-plugin)
and the `-dry-run` flag, which outputs the list of instances pending upgrade.

If you find instances that are pending upgrade, reapply the service instance upgrade with the
current version of the broker before staging the new version of the tile. To reapply the instance
upgrade:

1. Ensure that you haven't staged the new version of the tile yet.
2. Review the [Important notes about upgrading service instances](#upgrade-notes).
3. Follow the steps from either
    - [Upgrade instances through the tile](#upgrading-instances-task) or
    - [Upgrade instances through the CLI plug-in](#upgrading-cli-plugin) from the CLI.

### <a id="upgrade-notes"></a> Important notes about upgrading service instances

Before you start upgrading service instances, see the following notes:

- **Enabling the Upgrade all services check box:**

  If the **Upgrade all services** check box is not selected, service instances are not upgraded
  during installation. These instances become unmanageable by the broker.
  Any operations on that instance, such as update, bind, unbind, or delete, are blocked
  until you run the upgrade task.
  You can run the upgrade task at any time before upgrading the product to a later version.

- **Enabling the Enable Beta offerings check box:**

  If the **Enable Beta offerings** check box is not selected when applying changes, instances from
  those service offerings are not upgraded. These instances become unmanageable by the broker.
  Ensure that the **Enable Beta offerings** check box is selected if you have instances from those
  offerings that you intend to keep updated.

- **Deleting custom plans:**

  If you delete custom plans before upgrading all instances, instances from these plans are not
  upgraded. These instances become unmanageable by the broker. Delete plans after upgrading all
  instances, or see [Release Notes for Cloud Service Broker for Azure](release-notes.html.md.erb) and
  [Upgrading to v1.5](#upgrading-specifics) to prevent conflicting upgrades.

- **Only upgrade the tile after all service instances are up to date:**

  You can run the upgrade all instances task as many times as needed.
  You can run the upgrade all instances task by using the cf CLI instead of,
  or in addition to, running it through the tile.
  Failure to upgrade one or more instances does not cause the tile installation to fail.
  Review the `deploy all` errand logs to ensure that all instances have upgraded.

### <a id="checking-cli-plugin"></a> Ensure that all instances are up to date with the CLI plug-in

To verify that no instances are pending upgrade:

1. Install the [cf CLI UpgradeAllServices plug-in on Cloud Foundry](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#UpgradeAllServices).
1. Follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the `README` in the
   [upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin#usage)
   GitHub repository to perform a dry run.

   For example:

   ```
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME -dry-run
   ```

This command provides a list of instances from enabled plans pending upgrade. If the list is not
empty, upgrade the instances listed before attempting a tile upgrade.

### <a id="upgrading-instances-task"></a> Upgrade instances through the tile

To upgrade service instances through the tile:

1. Configure the **Upgrade All Service Instances** task. For more information, see
   [Upgrade All Service Instances Configuration](installing-with-azure.html.md.erb#upgrade-all-config).
1. Apply the changes.
1. Review the `deploy-all` log entries for failures.

### <a id="upgrading-cli-plugin"></a> Upgrade instances through the CLI plug-in

To run the cf CLI plug-in:

1. Install the [cf CLI UpgradeAllServices plug-in on Cloud Foundry](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#UpgradeAllServices).
1. To run the upgrade, follow the instructions in the **Usage** section of the `README` in the
   [upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/upgrade-all-services-cli-plugin#usage)
   GitHub repository.

   For example:

   ```
   cf upgrade-all-services BROKER-NAME
   ```

Run the CLI plug-in with the `-dry-run` flag before applying the service instance upgrade to find
out which instances are pending upgrade.

## <a id="upgrading-specifics"></a> Upgrade to v1.5

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.product_full %> v1.5.0 removes the brokerpak preconfigured subsume
  plan for <strong>Azure SQL MSSQL Database Instance</strong> and for <strong>Azure SQL MSSQL Failover Group</strong>.
  If you have instances that were created in previous versions subsuming them, you must change the plan
  before upgrading.
  See next steps to get an overview of the process to run.
</p>

### Steps needed to upgrade subsumed instances

1. Update service instance to another plan:

   ```bash
    cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME> -p NEW-PLAN
   ```
   Where:

   - SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME is the name of the service instance.
   - NEW-PLAN is the name of the new plan.

2. Follow the [Upgrade procedure](#procedure).
