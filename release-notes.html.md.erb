## <a id="1-3-1"></a> v1.3.1

**Release Date:** November 8, 2022

### Resolved issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **Service offering logos now show up in Apps Manager:**
  Previously when provisioning services through Apps Manager, service logos did not appear.
  This made it difficult to identify the offering from similar ones installed on the platform.
  Service offerings now display a generic Tanzu logo.

* **Fix issue with limits to environment variables length when installing the tile:**
  In previous versions, the broker deployed by the tile was configured through environment variables.
  This caused environments with lengthy configurations to hit a limit on the size of environment variables.
  From this version, the tile uses a configuration file written during the deployment process that
  overcomes such limits. No action is needed.

### Known issues

This release has the following issue:

* **Values containing single ticks break broker configuration:**
  If the tile provided value contains `'`, cloud-service-broker cannot parse the generated broker
  configuration.
  To prevent this issue, replace the wrapping `'` with YAML multiline notation.

## <a id="1-3-0"></a> v1.3.0

**Release Date:** August 5, 2022

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **The internal Terraform was upgraded to v1.1:**
  Terraform v1.1 enables the product to make use of new features in Azure.
  All service instances must be upgraded. For more information, see
  [Upgrading Cloud Service Broker for Azure](upgrading.html) and
  [Issues with Upgrading Service Instances to v1.3](upgrading.html#known-issues)

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* **Incompatible changes upgrading some services from some versions:**
  Some services cannot be upgraded from previous versions.
  For more information, see [Issues with Upgrading Service Instances to v1.3](upgrading.html#known-issues).

* **Limits to environment variables length when installing the tile:**
  The broker deployed by the tile is configured through environment variables.
  This causes installations with several plans or other lengthy configurations to hit a limit on the
  size of environment variables in the platform.
  This limit prevents the broker app from starting, which causes the deployment to fail.
