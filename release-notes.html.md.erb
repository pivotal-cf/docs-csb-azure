These are release notes for <%= vars.product_full %>.

##<a id="1-2-0"</a> v1.2.0

**Release Date:** October 4, 2021

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* **Support for encryption of sensitive data:** <%= vars.product_short %> can now encrypt sensitive
data that is provided or generated during provisioning and binding and stored in the state database.
A key generated from the password you configure in the tile is used for the encryption.
For how to configure encryption, see <a href="installing-with-azure.html#state-db">Configure a State Database</a>.

* **Support for Private Endpoints in MongoDB:** <%= vars.product_short %> now supports creating Private Endpoints
during the provisioning of MongoDB instances.
For more information, see [pull request #103](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/csb-brokerpak-azure/pull/103) in GitHub.

* **`azurerm_mssql_database` - Databases smaller then 1&nbsp;GB can be subsumed:**
Subsume is now supported for MSSQL databases less then 1&nbsp;GB.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **Use restricted user to connect to CredHub:** The broker uses `cf.uaa.services_credhub_credentials`
instead of `cf.uaa.credhub_admin_client_client_credentials` to communicate with CredHub.
The new credentials have restricted access.

* **Update optional mini plans:** `mini` plans for `csb-azure-eventhubs`, `csb-azure-mssql`
and `csb-azure-mssql-db-failover-group` were reusing identifiers and were not compatible
with  <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> v2.11.
They have been renamed to `mini-v2` and their IDs have been updated to be unique.
If you were using any of these plans in the mentioned service offerings, update all instances to use `mini-v2`.

* **`csb-azure-mssql-failover-group` - Users are propagated to the secondary database:**
You no longer need to rebind apps after a failover event.
