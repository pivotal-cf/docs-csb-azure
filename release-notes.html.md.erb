## <a id="1-3-1"></a> v1.3.1

**Release Date:** November 14, 2022

### Known issues

This release has the following known issues.

* **Values containing single ticks break broker configuration:**
  If the tile provided value contains `'`, cloud-service-broker cannot parse the generated broker
  configuration.
  To prevent this issue, replace the wrapping `'` with YAML multiline notation.

### Resolved issues

This release has the following fixes.

* **Service Offering logos now show up in Apps Manager:**
  Previously when provisioning services through Apps Manager, the logo did not appear in
  Apps Manager. This made it difficult to identify the offering from similar ones installed on the
  platform. Service Offerings now display a generic Tanzu logo.

* **Fix issue with limits to environment variables length when installing the tile:**
  In previous versions, the broker deployed by the tile is configured through environment variables.
  This causes environments with several plans or other lengthy configurations to hit a limit on
  the size of environment variables in the platform.
  From this version, the tile uses a configuration file written during the deployment process that
  overcomes such limits. No action is needed.

### Known Issues

* **Incompatible changes upgrading some services from some versions:**
  Some services cannot be upgraded from previous versions.
  For more information, see [Issues with Upgrading Service Instances to v1.3](upgrading.html#known-issues).

* **Limits to environment variables length when installing the tile:**
  The broker deployed by the tile is configured through environment variables.
  This causes installations with several plans or other lengthy configurations to hit a limit on the
  size of environment variables in the platform.
  This limit prevents the broker app from starting, which causes the deployment to fail.
