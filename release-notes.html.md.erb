These are release notes for <%= vars.product_full %>.

##<a id="1-4-1"></a> v1.4.1

**Release Date:** January 24, 2023

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **Azure PostgreSQL & Azure MySQL binding credentials**: The URI and JDBC attributes
in the binding credentials now have the username URI-encoded. This tackles potential issues
when validating those attributes as Azure includes a `@` character in the username.

* **Attempting to delete an already deleted binding is now successful**: When attempting
to delete a binding that does not exist, CSB will now return a `410 GONE` code as required by
the OSBAPI specification. This fixes issues when the platform might timeout waiting
for the operation to be completed on the IaaS, resulting in the binding not being deleted from the platform
but further attempts to remove it failing as it was eventually deleted from the broker database.

##<a id="1-4-0"></a> v1.4.0

**Release Date:** December 8, 2022

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

#### Azure Redis service

* **Redis version:** You can now define the Redis version using the `redis_version`
property as part of a plan definition or during create or update operations.
To update Redis instances to v6, see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_full %>](upgrading.html#redis).

* **Brokerpak-provided plans are deprecated:** All brokerpak-provided plans for Redis are now deprecated.
VMware recommends that you create your custom plans in the tile.
All deprecated plans set the Redis version to v4 to keep backwards compatibility.
These plans will be removed from the brokerpak in future releases in favor of custom-defined plans in the tile.
To update Redis instances to other plans, see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_full %>](upgrading.html#redis).

#### Azure Cosmos DB service

* **Cosmos DB SQL can now create private endpoints:** You can now define private endpoints for
  Cosmos DB SQL using the `private_endpoint_subnet_id` and `private_dns_zone_ids` properties as part
  of a plan definition or during create or update operations.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

<%= partial '/csb/logo-resolved' %>

### Known Issues

* **Azure PostgreSQL & Azure MySQL binding credentials contain invalid URIs**: The URI and JDBC attributes
in the binding credentials include a `@` character in the username for these services. This can cause
some parsing or client libraries to fail due to validations as `@` is a reserved character in the URI spec and
needs to be URI-encoded.

* **Attempting to delete an already deleted binding fails**: When attempting
to delete a binding that does not exist, CSB returns a `HTTP 500` code instead of the
`HTTP 410` required by the OSBAPI specification. This results in issues when the platform times out waiting
for the operation to be completed on the IaaS, resulting in the binding not being deleted from the platform
but further attempts to remove it failing as it was eventually deleted from the broker database.
