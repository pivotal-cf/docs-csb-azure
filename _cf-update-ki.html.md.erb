* **Parameters specified during service instance updates are not persisted by subsequent updates:**
If a parameter is set or changed when a service instance is updated,
then the same parameter and value must be specified again when the
service instance is next updated.
Otherwise, the parameters revert to the values they had when the service instance was created.
