### <a id="state-db"></a>Configure a State Database

This section describes how to associate <%= vars.product_short %> with a MySQL database,
the _state database_.
The broker requires this database to store its state.

**Prerequisite:** A small MySQL database to use as the state database.

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> with a database:

1. Click **Service Broker Config**.

1. Enter the credentials for the state database.

1. Set up encryption for the sensitive data in the database.

    * If you want the sensitive data to be encrypted in the database tick **Enable encryption of the Cloud Service Broker database** and add an encryption password in the list of **Database Encryption Passwords**.
    For the password configure these fields:
        * **Label**: Enter a unique password label. Do not change once saved.
        * **Password**: Enter a secure password that is at least 20 characters long. Do not change once saved.
        * **Primary**: Tick if this is the password that should be used to encrypt the data. You must mark one password as primary. Do not mark more than one password as primary.

    * If you have already succesfully set an encryption password and want to rotate it you should:
        * Untick **Primary** field from the password that is currently being used.
        * Add a new encryption password in the list of **Database Encryption Passwords** and tick **Primary**.
        * After this installation is completed successfully we recommend you remove all non primary passwords and apply changes again. 

    * If you want the sensitive data to not be encrypted in the database untick **Enable encryption of the Cloud Service Broker database**.
        * If the data was previously encrypted and you want to dissable encryption you should provide the password used to encrypt in the list of **Database Encryption Passwords** with **Primary** field untiked and all other fields unchanged. If you provide several passwords untick the "Primary" from all passwords provided.
        * After this installation is completed successfully we recommend you remove all passwords and apply changes.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply changes** to install the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

<%# If needed, include additional configuration information below.
For example, maybe there are configuration options not required for installation but which could be
useful for certain users.
Typical topics include:**

+ **Self-service:** Do you have recommendations for how to configure/design plans in the tile so that
users can choose the best options for themselves?
+ **High availability:** How do you configure/deploy X Service tile to be highly available? %>
